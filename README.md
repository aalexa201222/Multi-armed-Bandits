# Multi-armed Bandits

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a k-armed bandit problem, focusing on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff using the epsilon-greedy algorithm. The assignment aims to provide hands-on experience with the OpenAI Gym environment, implement a custom k-armed bandit environment within the Gym framework, and explore the impact of the exploration parameter epsilon on the algorithm's performance.

## Background
In the realm of natural language processing, the need for machinery capable of processing sequences of words has led to the prominence of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Unlike standard fully-connected networks, RNNs operate on sequences of vectors, making them suitable for tasks involving larger linguistic units like phrases, sentences, and dialogues.

The project takes a gradual approach, starting with an understanding of RNNs, moving on to building a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) from scratch, and ultimately applying the SRN for POS tagging.
