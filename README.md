# Multi-armed Bandits

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a k-armed bandit problem, focusing on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff using the epsilon-greedy algorithm. The assignment aims to provide hands-on experience with the OpenAI Gym environment, implement a custom k-armed bandit environment within the Gym framework, and explore the impact of the exploration parameter epsilon on the algorithm's performance.

## Key Features
- Familiarization with OpenAI Gym: Introduction to the OpenAI Gym/gymnasium environment for reinforcement learning tasks.
- Implementation of k-armed Bandit Environment: Creation of a custom k-armed bandit environment using the OpenAI Gym framework.
- Epsilon-greedy Algorithm: Implementation of the epsilon-greedy algorithm to determine the optimal action in the k-armed bandit problem.
- Exploration and Exploitation: Exploration of the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation by adjusting the epsilon parameter.
